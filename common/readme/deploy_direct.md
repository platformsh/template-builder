1. Create a free trial:

   [Register for a 30 day free trial with Platform.sh](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register). When you have completed signup, select the **Create from scratch** project option. Give you project a name, and select a region where you would like it to be deployed. As for the *Production environment* option, make sure to match it to this repository's settings, or to what you have updated the default branch to locally.

1. Install the Platform.sh CLI

   Follow the instructions to [install the Platform.sh CLI](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/cli.html) for your operating system.
   You can verify the installation by logging in (`platformsh login`) and listing your projects (`platform project:list`).

1. Set the project remote

   Find your `PROJECT_ID` by running the command `platform project:list`

   ```bash
   +---------------+------------------------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
   | ID            | Title                              | Region           | Organization                    |
   +---------------+------------------------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
   | PROJECT_ID    | Your Project Name                  | xx-5.platform.sh | your-username                   |
   +---------------+------------------------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
   ```

   Then from within your local copy, run the command `platform project:set-remote PROJECT_ID`.

1. Push

   ```bash
   git push platform DEFAULT_BRANCH
   ```
