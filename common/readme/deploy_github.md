1. Create a free trial:

   [Register for a 30 day free trial with Platform.sh](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register). When you have completed signup, select the **Create from scratch** project option. Give you project a name, and select a region where you would like it to be deployed. As for the *Production environment* option, make sure to match it to whatever you have set at `https://YOUR_NAMESPACE/nextjs-drupal`.

1. Install the Platform.sh CLI

   Follow the instructions to [install the Platform.sh CLI](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/cli.html) for your operating system.
   You can verify the installation by logging in (`platformsh login`) and listing your projects (`platform project:list`).

1. Setup the integration:

   Consult the [GitHub integration documentation](https://docs.platform.sh/integrations/source/github.html#setup) to finish connecting your repository to a project on Platform.sh. You will need to create an Access token on GitHub to do so.
