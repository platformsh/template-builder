The `.environment` file is a convenient place to [set environment variables](https://docs.platform.sh/development/variables/set-variables.html#set-variables-via-script) relevant to your applications that may be dependent on the current environment. It is sourced before the start command is run, as the first step in the `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks, and at the beginning of each session when you SSH into an application container. It is written in dash, so be aware of the differences to bash. It can be used to set any environment variable, including ones that depend on Platform.sh-provided variables like `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` and `PLATFORM_ROUTES`, or to modify `PATH`. This file should not [produce output](https://docs.platform.sh/development/variables/set-variables.html#testing-environment-scripts).
