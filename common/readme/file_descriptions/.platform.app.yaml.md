This file is required to define the build and deploy process for all application containers on Platform.sh. Within this file, the runtime version, relationships to service containers, and writable mounts are configured. It's also in this file that it is defined what dependencies are installed, when they are installed, and that package manager will be used to do so.<br><br>Take a look at the [Application](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app.html) documentation for more details about configuration. For more information about the sequence of events that lead from a build to deployment, see the [Build and deploy timeline documentation](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/build-deploy.html).
