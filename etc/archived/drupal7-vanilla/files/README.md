This template builds a Drupal 7 site, with the entire site committed to Git.

Drupal is a flexible and extensible PHP-based CMS framework.  Version 7 is the legacy support version.

## Services

* PHP 7.2
* MariaDB 10.2

## Post-install

1. Run through the Drupal installer as normal by visiting `<project url>/install.php`.  You will not be asked for database credentials as those are already provided.

2. Once Drupal is fully installed, We strongly recommend switching to Redis-based caching.  See [the documentation](https://docs.platform.sh/frameworks/drupal7/redis.html) for instructions on how to do so.

## Customizations

The following changes have been made relative to Drupal 7 as it is downloaded from Drupal.org.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* The `/public/sites/default/settings.platformsh.php` file contains Platform.sh-specific code to map environment variables into Drupal configuration. You can add to it as needed. See [the documentation](https://docs.platform.sh/frameworks/drupal7.html) for more examples of common snippets to include here.
* The `/public/sites/default/settings.php` file has been heavily customized to only define those values needed for both Platform.sh and local development.  It calls out to `settings.platformsh.php` if available.  You can add additional values as documented in `default.settings.php` as desired.  It is also setup such that when you install Drupal on Platform.sh the installer will not ask for database credentials as they will already be defined.
