The `.environment` file is a convenient place to [set environment variables](https://docs.platform.sh/development/variables/set-variables.html#set-variables-via-script) relevant to your applications that may be dependent on the current environment. It is sourced before the start command is run, as the first step in the `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks, and at the beginning of each session when you SSH into an application container. It is written in dash, so be aware of the differences to bash.<br><br>It can be used to set any environment variable, including ones that depend on Platform.sh-provided variables like `PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS` and `PLATFORM_ROUTES`, or to modify `PATH`. This file should not [produce output](https://docs.platform.sh/development/variables/set-variables.html#testing-environment-scripts).<br><br>
