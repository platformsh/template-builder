<summary>What is Platform.sh?</summary><br/>

Platform.sh is a unified, secure, enterprise-grade platform for building, running and scaling web applications. Weâ€™re the leader in Fleet Ops: Everything you need to manage your fleet of websites and apps is available from the start. Because infrastructure and workflows are handled from the start, apps just work, so teams can focus on what really matters: making faster changes, collaborating confidently, and scaling responsibly. Whether managing a fleet of ten or ten thousand sites and apps, Platform.sh is the Developer- preferred solution that scales right.

Our key features include:

* **GitOps: Git as the source of truth**

    Every branch becomes a development environment, and nothing can change without a commit. 

* **Batteries included: Managed infrastructure**

    [Simple abstraction in YAML](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/yaml.html) for [committing and configuring infrastructure](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/structure.html), fully managed patch updates, and 24 [runtimes](https://docs.platform.sh/languages.html) & [services](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services.html) that can be added with a single line of code.

* **Instant cloning: Branch, merge, repeat**

    [Reusable builds](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/build-deploy.html) and automatically inherited production data provide true staging environments - experiment in isolation, test, then destroy or merge.  

* **FleetOps: Fleet management platform**

    Leverage our public API along with custom tools like [Source Operations](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app/source-operations.html) and [Activity Scripts](https://docs.platform.sh/integrations/activity.html) to [manage thousands of applications](https://youtu.be/MILHG9OqhmE) - their dependency updates, fresh content, and upstream code.
