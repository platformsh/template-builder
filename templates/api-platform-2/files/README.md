   We have just created a new multi-app project for you, based on <a href="https://api-platform.com/docs/core/" target="_blank">API Platform component</a> and <a href="https://api-platform.com/docs/admin/" target="_blank">API Platform Admin</a>.
   <BR>The generated code has been optimized for a typical web application hosted on <a href="https://platform.sh/">Platform.sh</a>.
</p>

### Features
- PHP 8.1
- PostgreSQL v13
- Composer-based build
- Yarn v1.22.15
- NodeJS v16

## Getting started

[comment]: <> (### Deploy)

### Quickstart

<p>
<a href="https://console.platform.sh/projects/create-project?template=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh-templates/API-Platform-v2/main/.platform/metadata/api-platform-3-php8.1.template.yaml&utm_content=platformsh-template&utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=deploy_on_platform" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://platform.sh/images/deploy/deploy-button-lg-blue.svg" alt="Deploy on Platform.sh" width="175px">
</a>
</p>

[Create a Platform.sh project](https://platform.sh/free-trial).

Clone the GitHub repository and push its content to your Platform.sh project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:platformsh-templates/API-Platform-v2.git
cd API-Platform-v2/
git remote add platform [project-id]@git.[region].platform.sh:[project-id].git
git push platform main
```

[comment]: <> (SSH to the `api` remote application and create the database schema:)

[comment]: <> (```)

[comment]: <> (ssh [project-id]-master-[string-identifier]--api@ssh.[region].platform.sh)

[comment]: <> (php bin/console doctrine:schema:create)

[comment]: <> (```)

You can now access the `admin` URL provided by Platform.sh and enjoy.

The quickest way to deploy this template on Platform.sh is by clicking the button below.
This will automatically create a new project and initialize the repository for you.

[comment]: <> (TODO You can also quickly recreate this project locally with the following command:)

[comment]: <> (```bash)

[comment]: <> (composer create-project platformsh-templates/API-Platform-v2:main -s dev)

[comment]: <> (```)


> **Note:**
>
> Platform.sh templates prioritize upstream release versions over our own. Despite this, we update template dependencies on a scheduled basis independent of those upstreams. <br>Because of this, template repos do not contain releases. This may change in the future, but until then the `-s dev` flag is necessary to use `composer create-project`.

#### Other deployment options

For all the other options below, clone this repository first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platformsh-templates/API-Platform-v2.git
```

If you're trying to deploy from GitHub, you can generate a copy of this repository first in your own namespace by clicking the [Use this template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/API-Platform-v2/generate) button at the top of this page.

Then you can clone a copy of it locally with `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAMESPACE/API-Platform-v2.git`.

<summary>Deploy directly to Platform.sh from the command line</summary>
<!-- <blockquote>
<br/> -->

1. Create a free trial:

   [Register for a 30 day free trial with Platform.sh](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register). When you have completed signup, select the **Create from scratch** project option. Give you project a name, and select a region where you would like it to be deployed. As for the *Production environment* option, make sure to match it to this repository's settings, or to what you have updated the default branch to locally.

1. Install the Platform.sh CLI

   #### Linux/OSX

   ```bash
   curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php
   ```

   #### Windows

   ```bash
   curl -f https://platform.sh/cli/installer -o cli-installer.php
   php cli-installer.php
   ```

   You can verify the installation by logging in (`platformsh login`) and listing your projects (`platform project:list`).

1. Set the project remote

   Find your `PROJECT_ID` by running the command `platform project:list`

   ```bash
   +---------------+------------------------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
   | ID            | Title                              | Region           | Organization                    |
   +---------------+------------------------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
   | PROJECT_ID    | Your Project Name                  | xx-5.platform.sh | your-username                   |
   +---------------+------------------------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+
   ```

   Then from within your local copy, run the command `platform project:set-remote PROJECT_ID`.

1. Push

   ```bash
   git push platform DEFAULT_BRANCH
   ```

### Local development

This section provides instructions for running the `API Platform` template locally, connected to a local database instance.

In all cases for developing with Platform.sh, it's important to develop on an isolated environment - do not connect to data on your production environment when developing locally.

Each of the options below assume that you have already deployed this template to Platform.sh, as well as the following starting commands:

<summary>API Platform: using Symfony Server</summary>
In general, the steps are as follows:

1. if you didn't get your Platform project yet, `git clone git@github.com:platformsh-templates/api-platform-api-admin.git api-platform`
   (or your own repo if you already created a fork)

2. `cd ./api-platform`

3. Start the API component with those steps:

   1. `cd ./api`

   1. Install the <a href="https://symfony.com/download" target="_blank">Symfony CLI</a>

   1. start docker container for the database : `docker-compose up -d`

   1. `symfony composer install`

   1. check that your api/.env file contains a valid `DATABASE_URL` to let Symfony connect to your database

   1. `symfony console doctrine:schema:create --dump-sql` (change to option `--force` to run those sql requests)

   1. `symfony server:start -d`

   1. et voilà, you can go on `<generatedUrlFromSymfonyServerStartCommand>/api` to display your swagger interface, showing entities Offer and Product CRUD option

> **Note:**
> if symfony server does not start your app using default port 8000, please change `REACT_APP_PUBLIC_URL` from `./admin/.env` file accordingly

3. Start the admin component with those steps

   1. `cd ../admin` (assuming that you're in the `./api` folder)

   1. `yarn install`

   1. `yarn start`

   1. et voilà, a new browser tab would open at url <a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a>

</details>

> **Note:**
> For many of the steps above, you may need to include the CLI flags `-p PROJECT_ID` and `-e ENVIRONMENT_ID` if you are not in the project directory or if the environment is associated with an existing pull request.
### Deploying to Platform.sh

This repository has all of the code it needs in order to deploy to Platform.sh.


<details>
<summary>Deploy directly to Platform.sh from the command line</summary>
<!-- <blockquote>
<br/> -->

1. Create a free trial:

   [Register for a 30 day free trial with Platform.sh](https://auth.api.platform.sh/register). When you have completed signup, select the **Create from scratch** project option. Give you project a name, and select a region where you would like it to be deployed.

### Migrating your data

If you are moving an existing site to Platform.sh, then in addition to code you also need to migrate your data. That means your database and your files.

<details>
<summary>Importing the database</summary><br/>

First, obtain a database dump from your current site and save your dump file as `database.sql`. Then, import the database into your Platform.sh site using the CLI:

```bash
platform sql -e main < database.sql
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Importing files</summary><br/>

You first need to download your files from your current hosting environment.
The easiest way is likely with rsync, but consult your old host's documentation.

The `platform mount:upload` command provides a straightforward way to upload an entire directory to your site at once to a `mount` defined in a `.platform.app.yaml` file.
Under the hood, it uses an SSH tunnel and rsync, so it is as efficient as possible.
(There is also a `platform mount:download` command you can use to download files later.)
Run the following from your local Git repository root (modifying the `--source` path if needed and setting `BRANCH_NAME` to the branch you are using).

A few examples are listed below, but repeat for all directories that contain data you would like to migrate.

```bash
$ platform mount:upload -e main --mount web/sites/default/files --source ./web/sites/default/files
$ platform mount:upload -e main --mount private --source ./private
```

Note that `rsync` is picky about its trailing slashes, so be sure to include those.

</details>

With your application now deployed on Platform.sh, things get more interesting.
Run the command `platform environment:branch new-feature` for your project, or open a trivial pull request off of your current branch.

The resulting environment is an *exact* copy of production.
It contains identical infrastructure to what's been defined in your configuration files, and even includes data copied from your production environment in its services.
On this isolated environment, you're free to make any changes to your application you need to, and really test how they will behave on production.

After that, here are a collection of additional resources you might find interesting as you continue with your migration to Platform.sh:

## Learn

### Troubleshooting


<details>
<summary><strong>Accessing logs</strong></summary><br/>

After the environment has finished its deployment, you can investigate issues that occured on startup, `deploy` and `post_deploy` hooks, and generally at runtime using the CLI. Run the command:

```bash
platform ssh
```

If you are running the command outside of a local copy of the project, you will need to include the `-p` (project) and/or `-e` (environment) flags as well.
Once you have connected to the container, [logs](https://docs.platform.sh/development/logs.html#container-logs) are available within `/var/log/` for you to investigate.

</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Rebuilding cache</strong></summary><br/>

You may run into a database error after installing Symfony on your production environment initially.
To fix, SSH into the application container (`platform ssh`) and rebuild the cache using Symfony console:

```bash
php bin/console cache:clear
php bin/console cache:pool:clear cache.redis
```

### About Platform.sh

This template has been specifically designed to deploy on Platform.sh.

<details>
<summary>What is Platform.sh?</summary><br/>

Platform.sh is a unified, secure, enterprise-grade platform for building, running and scaling web applications. We’re the leader in Fleet Ops: Everything you need to manage your fleet of websites and apps is available from the start. Because infrastructure and workflows are handled from the start, apps just work, so teams can focus on what really matters: making faster changes, collaborating confidently, and scaling responsibly. Whether managing a fleet of ten or ten thousand sites and apps, Platform.sh is the Developer- preferred solution that scales right.

Our key features include:

* **GitOps: Git as the source of truth**

  Every branch becomes a development environment, and nothing can change without a commit.

* **Batteries included: Managed infrastructure**

  [Simple abstraction in YAML](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/yaml.html) for [committing and configuring infrastructure](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/structure.html), fully managed patch updates, and 24 [runtimes](https://docs.platform.sh/languages.html) & [services](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services.html) that can be added with a single line of code.

* **Instant cloning: Branch, merge, repeat**

  [Reusable builds](https://docs.platform.sh/overview/build-deploy.html) and automatically inherited production data provide true staging environments - experiment in isolation, test, then destroy or merge.

* **FleetOps: Fleet management platform**

  Leverage our public API along with custom tools like [Source Operations](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app/source-operations.html) and [Activity Scripts](https://docs.platform.sh/integrations/activity.html) to [manage thousands of applications](https://youtu.be/MILHG9OqhmE) - their dependency updates, fresh content, and upstream code.
