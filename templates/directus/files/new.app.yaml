# Directus Starter for Platform.sh                                
# 
# ABOUT
# 
# This template demonstrates building Directus for Platform.sh. It includes a quickstart application configured to run
# with PostgreSQL. It is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs.    
#
# Directus is an open-source platform that allows you to create and manage an API from data stored in a database. 
#
# Contents:
#   * Pre-build definitions:    Setting up the application container.
#   * Build and deploy:         Configuring repeatable builds and final deployments.
#   * Web:                      Declare how the application handles requests.
#   * Scheduled tasks:          Application and maintenance cron jobs.
#   * Source                    Define operations that can be performed on the codebase and code location.

# PRE-BUILD DEFINITIONS
#     
# The following attributes define how the application is built prior to your build hook. From here, you can define
# the primary runtime, build dependencies, and whether the default build `flavor` for the runtime used to install
# dependencies from your lock file.                                                                                 
#                                                                                                                     
# name (required):
# The name of the application container. It's from this value that traffic can be directed to an application container
# by defining an `upstream` in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, or when defining a relationship between two application
# containers. Because of this, this value must be unique across your project cluster.
name: app
#      
# type (required):
# The name of the application container. It's from this value that traffic can be directed to an application container
# by defining an `upstream` in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, or when defining a relationship between two application
# containers. Because of this, this value must be unique across your project cluster.

# variables (optional):

# by defining an `upstream` in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, or when defining a relationship between two application
# containers. Because of this, this value must be unique across your project cluster..

build:
    # flavor: 
    # The `flavor` attribute tells Platform.sh how it should handle dependencies specified in your application's 
    # lock file. For the `nodejs` runtime, there are only two possible values for `flavor`:
    #     * `default`: `npm prune --userconfig .npmrc && npm install --userconfig .npmrc` when package.json present,
    #     * `none`: No install performed. This can be useful if you'd like to use yarn instead of npm, for example.
    flavor: none
#     
# dependencies (optional): 
# The name of the application container. It's from this value that traffic can be directed to an application container
# by defining an `upstream` in a `.platform/routes.yaml` file, or when defining a relationship between two application
# containers. Because of this, this value must be unique across your project cluster.
