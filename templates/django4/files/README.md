This template deploys the Django 4 application framework on Platform.sh, using the gunicorn application runner.  It also includes a PostgreSQL database connection pre-configured.

Django is a Python-based web application framework with a built-in ORM.

## Features

* Python 3.9
* PostgreSQL 12
* Automatic TLS certificates
* Pipfile-based build

## Customizations

The following files have been added to a basic Django configuration.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* An additional Pip library, [`platformshconfig`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-python), has been added.  It provides convenience wrappers for accessing the Platform.sh environment variables.
* A rudimentary `myapp` application is included for demonstration purposes.  In particular, the `settings.py` file is set up to configure Django to connect to the correct database, and run in Debug mode when not running the `master` branch.  You are free to change that configuration if you prefer.
