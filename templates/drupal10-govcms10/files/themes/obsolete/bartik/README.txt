ABOUT BARTIK
------------

Bartik was the default theme for Drupal 8 and 9. It has been removed from
Drupal 10 and replaced with a modern equivalent, Olivero.

This theme is available for existing sites that may need it, but we do not
recommend using it on a new site.

The Bartik theme is named after Jean Bartik, one of the original programmers
for the ENIAC computer.

This theme is not intended to be used as a base theme.
