  description: |
    <p>This template builds Drupal 9 in a multisite configuration using the "Drupal Recommended" Composer project.  It is pre-configured to use MariaDB and Redis for caching.  The Drupal installer will skip asking for database credentials as they are already provided.</p>
    <p>It also includes instructions and a script to help with setting up additional multisite instances, although depending on your particular needs it may require some customization.</p>
    <p>Drupal is a flexible and extensible PHP-based CMS framework capable of hosting multiple sites on a single code base.</p>
