# This file defines one application within your project. Each application is rooted
# at the directory where this file exists, and will produce a single application
# container to run your code.  The basic file below contains only the required
# options. To get to a running application you'll need at least to supply
# a real "start" command.
# See https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app-containers.html#configure-your-application

    ## typically starting your application.

## You can add services in .platform/services.yaml, to use them in your application
## you will need to create a relationship for example:
#
relationships:
    essearch: "searchelastic:elasticsearch"
    kibana: "kibana:http"

# The size in megabytes of persistent disk space to reserve as part of this application.
disk: 1024

## Each mount is a pairing of the local path on the application container to
## the persistent mount where it lives. At this time, only 'shared:files' is
## a supported mount.
