# This file defines one application within your project. Each application is rooted
# at the directory where this file exists, and will produce a single application
# container to run your code.  The basic file below contains only the required
# options. To get to a running application you'll need at least to supply
# a real "start" command.
# See https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app-containers.html#configure-your-application

## Each mount is a pairint of the local path on the application container to
