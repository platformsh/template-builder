# Platform.sh Project Initialization Template
#
# This file defines settings and workflow modifications that allow a git
# repository to be deployed to Platform.sh and its white-label partners. A
# project template can be a fully functioning ready-made application or a
# quick-start point for custom development work.
#
# It contains elements that affect the behaviour upon the initialisation of
# a new project (for example minimal plan sizes) as well as elements that
# allow Platform.sh to present it in a user interface (such as the description
# of the project, tags, an icon etc.).
#
# Once provisioned this file has no effects on the running project.  You
# are free to remove it.
# The schema is versioned so that we can establish code paths differently in the future if we need to change this.
version: 1

# Templates are a small amount of information supporting a template URL. Each template is selectable at the project-creation step.
info:
  # Unique machine name, prefaced by a vendor or organization identifier
  id: platformsh/fastapi
  # The human-readable name of the template.
  name: FastAPI
  # Human-readable descriptive text for the template. Supports limited HTML.

      <p>This template demonstrates building the FastAPI framework for Platform.sh.  It includes a minimalist application skeleton that demonstrates how to connect to a MariaDB server for data storage and Redis for caching.  The application starts as a bare Python process with no separate runner.  It is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs.</p>
      <p>FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.</p>

# This key describes the initialization call made to the master environment at
# project creation time. This is part of the full v2 UI operation mode, which
# places project schema/options selection early in the creation process, rather
# than later as it exitss now. To allow this schema to be backwards-compatible,
# this key also gets mapped to the appropriate location in project.settings so
# that the current UI can have its own workflow overridden as well.
