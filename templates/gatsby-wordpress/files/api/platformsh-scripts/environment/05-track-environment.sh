# NOTE:
#
# This script tracks settings that have changed related to the the Gatsby-WordPress connection for a particular
#   environment on Platform.sh. Throughout setup, plenty has been updated to ensure that for any given environment,
#   a unique Gatsby app container connects with its own unique Drupal container, and that this relationship is seemless
#   across branching commits as well as local development work.
#
# Here, a few last minute things are updated:
#   1) The current frontend URL is updated for the environment.
#   2) If this is the project's first every push, successful installation is logged.
#   3) Gatsby, both on Platform.sh and locally, relies on environment variables typically included in a .env file.
#       Rather than forcing the Gatsby container to build this file, the CMS is considered to be the source of truth and
#       assumes that responsibility here. This script pulls everything Gatsby needs from our settings file we've been
#       using to track the environment, and generates the required file in a Network Storage mount that Gatsby can access.
#       For now, this approach seemed best, as it gives a readily accessible environment file for switching out a variety
#       of frontend consumers simply by defining a mount. This may change, but seemed like the best option currently.
