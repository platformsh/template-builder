# ABOUT:
#
# This script has been included to deploy a demo WordPress application, that is seeded with a number of dummy posts, and
#   that is meant to have its API consumed by a frontend Gatsby client. Not all pieces of this script will be relevant
#   for your migration. It's meant to automate steps outlined in the Gatsby-WordPress guide, which you can follow
#   manually during your own migration from there (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/wordpress/).
#
# When migrating your own site, the only pieces that will not be immediately relevant are those involved with creating
#   demo content posts, which is run when the project level environment variable CREATE_DEMO_CONTENT is set to true in
#   WordPress' .platform.app.yaml file. If copying these files exactly, you can remove or set to false, and it should
#   contain everything you need to run Gatsby and WordPress across environments.
#
# It is meant to be run on a Platform.sh environment during the deploy hook.
#
########################################################################################################################
# NOTE:
#
# There are a lot of moving pieces in this demo, so included is a platformsh-scripts/settings.default.json file meant to
#   track it all. In this first step, the file is copied to the Network Storage mount 'deploy'. This does two things.
#   First, we can write to it at runtime, and second, the Gatsby app will have access to it as well, which is helpful
#   for keeping the two apps in sync across environments. Initial settings committed to the demo (INITAL_DEMO_SETTINGS)
#   are moved to the mount early in the script (ENV_SETTINGS).

#   b. Project installation: only performed during first deployment on a new project.
#   c. Environment configuration: performed during the first push on a new environment.
#   d. WordPress tasks: performed on every deployment.
