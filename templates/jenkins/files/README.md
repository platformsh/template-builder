This project provides a starter kit for Jenkins projects hosted on Platform.sh.  The Jenkins `.war` file is downloaded during the build hook and not included in the repository.

Jenkins is an open source automation server written in Java. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

## Features

* Java 11
* Automatic TLS certificates
* Jenkins downloaded on the fly during build

## Post-install

1. After creating a Jenkins project, the post-installation setup wizard begins.
2. When you first access a new Jenkins instance, you are asked to unlock it using an automatically-generated password.
3. Browse to the Jenkins service link and wait until the Unlock Jenkins page appears.
4. From the Jenkins console log output, copy the automatically-generated alphanumeric password
5. (Execute: `platform ssh cat /app/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword` and copy the output)[https://docs.platform.sh/development/access-site.html#accessing-the-application-with-ssh]
6. On the Unlock Jenkins page, paste this password into the Administrator password field and click Continue.
