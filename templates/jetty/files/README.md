This template provides an Eclipse Jetty Web server and javax.servlet container, plus support for HTTP/2, WebSocket, OSGi, JMX, JNDI, JAAS and many other integrations.  Jetty itself is downloaded on the fly in the build hook based on the provided `pom.xml` file.

Eclipse Jetty is used in a wide variety of projects and products, both in development and production. Jetty can be easily embedded in devices, tools, frameworks, application servers, and clusters.
