This project provides a starter kit for Open Liberty Eclipse MicroProfile projects hosted on Platform.sh.  It includes a minimalist application skeleton that is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs, along with the Platform.sh Config Reader to simplify accessing Platform.sh environment variables.

Open Liberty is a highly composable, fast to start, dynamic application server runtime environment.

## Features

* Java 11
* Automatic TLS certificates
* Maven-based build
