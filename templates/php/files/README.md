# PHP project template for Platform.sh

This project provides a starter kit for a super-basic PHP project hosted on [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh).

## Starting a new project

To start a new project based on this template, follow these 3 simple steps:

1. Clone this repository locally. You may optionally remove the origin remote or remove the .git directory and re-init the project if you want a clean history.

2. Create a new project through the Platform.sh user interface and select "Import an existing project" when prompted.

3. Run the provided Git commands to add a Platform.sh remote and push the code to the Platform.sh repository.

That's it! You now have a working "hello world" level project you can build on.

## Using as a reference

You can also use this repository as a reference for your own projects, and borrow whatever code is needed. The most important parts are the .platform.app.yaml file and the .platform directory.
