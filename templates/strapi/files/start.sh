# For the sake of this template, Strapi defaults to a development environment.
# You can add new Content Types from the start, but you should replace your start
# command with `yarn start` for production environments when taking the
# application live. (Example below)
yarn develop

# Environment-specific configuration for Strapi.
# if [ "$PLATFORM_BRANCH" = master ]; then
#    yarn start
