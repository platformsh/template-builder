This project provides a starter kit for Apache Tomcat hosted on Platform.sh.  Tomcat itself is downloaded on the fly in the build hook based on the provided `pom.xml` file.

Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and WebSocket technologies.

## Features

* Java 11
