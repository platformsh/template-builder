# WordPress for Platform.sh

This template builds WordPress on Platform.sh using the [`johnbolch/wordpress`](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) "Composer Fork" of WordPress.  Plugins and themes should be managed with Composer exclusively.  A custom configuration file is provided that runs on Platform.sh to automatically configure the database, so the installer will not ask you for database credentials.  For local-only configuration you can use a `wp-config-local.php` file that gets excluded from Git.

WordPress is a blogging and lightweight CMS written in PHP.

## Features

* PHP 7.4
* MariaDB 10.4
* Automatic TLS certificates
* Composer-based build

## Post-install

1. Run through the WordPress installer as normal.  You will not be asked for database credentials as those are already provided.

2. This example looks for an optional `wp-config-local.php` in the project root that you can use to develop locally. This file is ignored in Git.

Example `wp-config-local.php`:

```php
<?php

define('WP_HOME', "http://localhost");
define('WP_SITEURL',"http://localhost");
define('DB_NAME', "my_wordpress");
define('DB_USER', "user");
define('DB_PASSWORD', "a strong password");
define('DB_HOST', "127.0.0.1");
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');
define('DB_COLLATE', '');

// These will be set automatically on Platform.sh to a different value, but that won't cause issues.
define('AUTH_KEY', 'SECURE_AUTH_KEY');
define('LOGGED_IN_KEY', 'LOGGED_IN_SALT');
define('NONCE_KEY', 'NONCE_SALT');
define('AUTH_SALT', 'SECURE_AUTH_SALT');
```

## Customizations

The following changes have been made relative to WordPress as it is downloaded from WordPress.org.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* It uses the [`johnbolch/wordpress`](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress) "Composer Fork" of WordPress, which allow the site to be managed entirely with Composer.
* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added.  These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh.  You may customize them as you see fit.
* An additional Composer library, [`platformsh/config-reader`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-php), has been added.  It provides convenience wrappers for accessing the Platform.sh environment variables.
* The `wp-config.php` file has been modified to use the Config Reader to configure WordPress based on Platform.sh environment variables if present.  If not, your own `wp-config-local.php` file will be loaded to configure the site for local development.
* The upstream `composer.json` file has been modified to include the script `movewpconfig`. It moves `wp-config.php` into the default install directory and docroot `wordpress` after composer install is run.
